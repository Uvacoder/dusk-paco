# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Dusk! ðŸ–¤

## Icon Requests

Want to see an icon for your favorite app? Want to offer an alternative icon? I'd love to include it.

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/pacocoursey/dusk/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:) with the title `Icon Request: <app name>`. If you have already designed the icon, please include a screenshot and a link to the SVG of the icon. If you have not, that's OK! Include some details and a link to the application and someone else will design it.

> Because Dusk icons span multiple projects (website, CLI, and react package), it is preferred that you open an issue rather than a pull request. This way, it can be added to each package reliably.

### Design Guidelines

Dusk icons aim to replicate the design of application icons with a single, defining element that is easily recognizable in any colorway. For example, the Safari application icon can be identified based solely on the compass needle.

Many application icons are sufficiently minimal and do not need modification. In the case of a complex design, please try to simplify it to a single design element.

### Format

Dusk icons are defined as SVG files. Use a circle of radius `256px` (height and width of `512px`). Center the design element within the circle. Generally, the design element should be constrained to a max height/width of `255px`, whichever is bigger. This limit is flexible. The size of the design element should feel natural and comparable to other icons.
